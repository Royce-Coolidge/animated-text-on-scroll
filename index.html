            Hi, I'm Rowley. Your coding partner. I help turn static figma designs into dynamic, scroll-triggered experiences across Shopify, Webflow, Squarespace, and WordPress.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your working on a project and want to add some dynamic text moments, need dev support, or just want to chat about animation, feel free to reach out! Always happy to share what I've learned along the way.

            You're a designer, not a developer. So why waste time wrestling with code when you could be doing what you love?  That's where I come in...
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in building loading page animations, text-reveal micro-interactions and 3D effects.
            <p>
            You stay focused on design, I handle the technical side, and your clients get websites that move as beautifully as they look. I've done this for hundreds of designers, and I'd love to help bring your next project to life
          </p>
